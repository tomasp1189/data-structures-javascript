# Algorithms

This section includes several algorithms implemented with javascript.

## Analysis of Algorithm (Big O Notation)

### Time Complexity

How the time of execution of the algorithm varies with the size of input data. The order of growth of the algorithm with the size of input data.

#### Types of Time Complexity

- Worst Case
- Best Case
- Average Case

#### How to calculate

We assume:

- We have infinite memory.
- Each operation (+, -, \*, /, =) takes one unit of time.
- For each memory access consumes one unit of time.
- Data is in the RAM.

### Space Complexity
